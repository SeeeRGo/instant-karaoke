She's a left out misfit, a stranger in the dark
Always walking by herself, never taking part
Ain't no storyteller, standing her ground
Softly strumming her guitar and weeping to the sound
Stared at in awe
Perfection, no flaw
Carries all that weight
Right underneath the masquerade
She is like a star on the rise
Looks at you with her angel eyes
She's gonna break your heart before you even know
She's like a fire in the hole
Gonna steal away your soul
Like I told you from the start
She's a hot pale girl with a cold black heart
She's sitting in the corner, black coffee on her lips
A cigarette is hanging in between her fingertips
She's somewhat of a goddess in that mini-dress
Look closely in her eyes, they are screaming SOS
Scars on the skin
The taste of the blood
Comfort in pain
Testify, just screams in vain
She is like a star on the rise
Looks at you with her angel eyes
She's gonna break your heart before you even know
She's like a fire in the hole
Gonna steal away your soul
Like I told you from the start
She's a hot pale girl with a cold black heart
She's a hot pale girl with a cold black heart
She's a hot pale girl with a cold black heart
It always feels the best, when it hurts the most
She's all alone, won't let anyone come close
A tiny spark of life, a taste of the sky
Losing herself, takes a breath for the very first time
She is like a star on the rise
Looks at you with her angel eyes
She's gonna break your heart before you even know
She's like a fire in the hole
Gonna steal away your soul
Like I told you from the start
She's a hot pale girl with a cold black heart
She's a hot pale girl with a cold black heart
She's a hot pale girl with a cold black heart
