Bela kisses you and reaches out for your heart
But his kisses cause your life to fall apart
Darkness devours you and he takes control
Bela drowns his pain together
With his wife in alcohol
Bela, Bela Kiss Kiss
Come clean some tiling lies
Did you really kill your wife?

Kiss of death and homicides

What kind of monster have you let yourself become?
How many women are still out there on your farm?
Your bare hands, their necks, you joked there
Your dark collection grows but Bela
Your cold heart stays forever broken

Come clean some tiling lies

Kiss of death and homicides
You adored your wife until she found herself a lover
But you made sure there was no happy ever after
And is still somewhere in your home with all the others
Carefully preserved, floating blood
Strange bodies
Bodies
