There are kisses you and winters out for your home.
There are kisses you and winters out for your home.
There are kisses you and winters out for your home.
There are drums you and winters out for your home.
There are kisses you and winters out for your home.
There are kisses you and winters out for your home.
Kiss of death and homicides.
What kind of monster have you left yet to become?
How many women are still out there on your phone?
You're the hands that make you jump there.
Your dark collection grows by feeling your cold heart.
Stay forever, broker.
Cutting some padding lies.
Take you really, kill your eyes for tell me that I want to.
Pickle them from all the eyes.
Kiss of death and homicides.
Cutting some padding lies.
Take you really, kill your eyes for tell me that I want to.
Pickle them from all the eyes.
Kiss of death and homicides.
You and all your wife until she follows her phone.
But you ain't sure that one's no happy ever after.
And it's still somewhere in your home with all the others.
Cutting some padding lies.
Take you really, kill your eyes for tell me that I want to.
Pickle them from all the eyes.
Kiss of death and homicides.
Cutting some padding lies.
Take you really, kill your eyes for tell me that I want to.
Pickle them from all the eyes.
Kiss of death and homicides.
Cutting some padding lies.
Take you really, kill your eyes for tell me that I want to.
Pickle them from all the eyes.
Kiss of death and homicides.
Of death and homicides.
Of death and homicides.
Kiss of death and homicides.
